# Arnon on Technology
Custom WordPress theme designed for my blog, [Arnon on Technology](https://blog.arnonerba.com/).

## Important Notes
This is not a "production-ready" WordPress theme, as it currently contains hard-coded paths and custom branding. It also fails to implement some common features and is not intended for general use. Regardless, it strives to be standards-compliant, and it is constantly being improved.

I will review pull requests; however, I may not merge them, as this is a personal project.
